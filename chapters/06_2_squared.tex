\section{1. Who was Voltaire?}
Mr. "Voltaire" was in fact "Francois-Marie Arouet" who supported Newton's laws by own means.
He thought if Newton can find a rational explanation for the universe, Voltaire
could find a rational explanation for the things going on on earth. e.g. the demanded
obedience of the king, Aristocrats who got authority from the king which nobody is allowed
to question this, the role of money, or other hidden forces in politics. After Francois
returned from Paris, three years after that he pushed those ideas. Due to his writings
the name Voltaire got more known than "Arouet".
The next thing he wanted to do was to find a place where he can put the seeds of
his studies, as it would not be possible to change the nation at once. Which was
Emilie du Chatelet

\section{2. What was Emilie du Châtelet like?}
Emilie was boy-like (a tomboy). She was strong, fast and had a good intellect
which most of the time kept her away from getting friends with others.
She was never really into men. More than that,
she frightened them away and challenged them etc. she climbed trees and did stuff boys
would do. Until she was 19. She then took a husband who was a soldier and was most
of the time away. She did that intentionally. And both agreed that she could have
affairs while he was out. One of those affairs was a twenty-something year old officer
"Pierre-Louis Maupertuis", who fulfilled her life until he left for a polar expedition.
Emilie needed a replacement for him. Then Voltaire came to replace him.
They shared the interest in political forms. Emilies husband (Du Chatelet) had a 
Chateau (old and abandoned) in Cirey (northern France), which was in his family since
Columbus came to America. Emilie and Voltaire then used it for Scientific researches.
The funny thing was, when Voltaire ordered the constructors to build a library
she ordered them to build a salon, where he planned to place elms, she planted lime
trees etc. Finally he still got a Library with seminar areas. The library was 
comparable to the Academy of Sciences in Paris.
Voltaire did alot of gossip during his researches and was distracted many times by
other stuff.
Emilie was more eager than Voltaire and was ALMOST about to jump-start future discoveries.
Finally she came up with the elementar key question: what is energy?
